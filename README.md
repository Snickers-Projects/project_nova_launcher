Project Nova is a project designed to allow for offline lan play of various steam games.

The project can be found here https://projectnova.us/community/resources/nova-simple-launcher.20/

This Launcher is designed to launch any game Project Nova supports, it dynamically changes its interface based on the game it detects.


You will also be able to switch between playlists that you find on the forum (If you have any).
Note that it's up to you to make sure you have the right playlist for the game you're running.

You can name the playlists whatever you want in the Playlists folder, just make sure its extension is correct. (As of version 1.5, all playlist file types are supported, so .aggr, .wad and .info will work, but is dependent on the game.)

To install, simply extract this launcher into your game folder along with "Ayria".
